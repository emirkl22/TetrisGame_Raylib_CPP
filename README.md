# Tetris-Raylib-CPP
  I've made this project for using oop essentials in game programming. A modular design has been used in this project. Also, the project was very useful for comprehending encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism principles. Throught the course I've followed up a Youtube video from Programming With Nick.
